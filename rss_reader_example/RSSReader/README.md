# RSS FEED

Hi Cater2.me team!

## How to setup:

in the Rails project directory:

`$ bundle install` <br>
`$ npm --yes init` <br>
`$ npm install` <br>
`$ rake test` <br>
`$ rails s` <br>

navigate to:

`http://localhost:3000`

enter the feed link for an RSS feed in the box,
maybe try: http://ppe.sagepub.com/rss/current.xml
